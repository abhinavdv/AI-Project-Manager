# Frontend (Not Used)

In this project, the frontend is implemented directly within the Flask application using server-rendered templates and vanilla JavaScript. 

The frontend assets are located in the `backend/static` and `backend/templates` directories.

This directory is kept as a placeholder in case a separate frontend framework (like React, Vue, or Angular) is desired in the future.
